    <h1>PIAIC</h1>

    <h2>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
    <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately
        funded not- <br/> for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi,
         Kazi Rahat Ali and <br/> Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities
         in emerging tech <br/> fields like
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li style="color: navy;">Cloud Native Computing</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
        <li>Internet Of Things</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Cloud Native computing:</h1>
    <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the students to program in open source 
    <br/> technologies like, <b>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</b>
    <br/> while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
    <br/> techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>

    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>The <b>artificial intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of
    the AI <br/> technology, via teachng programming in open source languages like <b>Python, Numpy, 
    Pandas, <br/> Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</b> and teaching deploying practical AI solution and use 
    cases and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.</p>

    <h1>Blockchain:</h1>
    <p>The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like 
    <b>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabric)</b> and learn to program in langueges such as Solidity,
JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of 
Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of 
Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of
a crypto-token.</p>

<h1>Internet of Things:</h1>
<p>The <b>Internet of things</b> program introduces the students to open source development <br/>
technologies like <b>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and
    Kubernetes</b> while making them effecient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT <br/>
Cloud and voice computing for device control.</p>
